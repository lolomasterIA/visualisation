# Interactive Data Visualization 

This project contains three Jupyter notebooks that showcase different interactive visualizations based on the `dpt2020.csv` dataset.

## Requirements

- Python **3.12.9**
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- A Python package manager (e.g., `pip`)

## Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # on Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows
   ```
2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open and run each notebook in your preferred order.
At the end of each notebook, you'll find an interactive visualization.
